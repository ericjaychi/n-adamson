							As a 2-D environment/concept artist based in Ontario, California, I help visualize worlds and settings that strive to present something new and memorable for viewers. Since graduating from UC Irvine and attending Gnomon School of Visual Effects, I have been working as a freelance artist since 2014. I enjoy figuring out how things work and combining different elements of ideas to create something unique and new. I like inventing places that clients have never seen before because I want to tell them a mesmerizing story and transport them to another world.<br><br>
							Previous experience includes illustrations and concept work for private commissioners, Fandango, and 4th Dimension Entertainment.
